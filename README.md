# Merrimack River Watershed CSO Management

An analysis of changing Land Cover/Land Use and related increases in CSO outfall events in the Lower Merrimack River Watershed region.

## Description

This project analyzes the correlation between changing land cover and land use over a 50-year period and the increasing frequency of combined sewer outfall (CSO) events in the lower Merrimack River watershed. By examining historical land use data, satellite imagery, and environmental reports, the study seeks to identify how urbanization, deforestation, and other land cover changes contribute to stormwater runoff and CSO occurrences. The findings provide insights into how regional land management practices may be linked to water quality issues and could inform future mitigation strategies to reduce CSO events.
